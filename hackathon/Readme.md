# Deep Learning Hackathon

The goal of this hackathon is to work through a small deep learning project. Several projects are available, which span different subject areas and difficulties:

- Training classifiers on standard datasets (beginner level)
- Generating images with autoencoders (beginner to intermediate)
- Reinforcement learning in OpenAI Roboschool (...)
- MetaClassification and learning to learn (...)
